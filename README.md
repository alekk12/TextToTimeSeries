# IML
Implementation of the Text to Time Series method, based on the [research](http://pike.psu.edu/publications/amw09.pdf) by Tao
Yang and Dongwon Lee. This function maps text data to time series data.
The data set used in this application is retrieved from [AITA subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole), a forum where users post
about their daily lives and other users rate them as YTA/NTA. The implementation fetches 1000 posts from AITA subreddit and maps text data using the TTS method.
